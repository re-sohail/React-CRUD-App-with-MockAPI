CRUD Operation in React JS

**Description**

A React application that demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities using a MockAPI. This project provides a solid foundation for building dynamic web applications that interact with data APIs.

**Features**

* Create new data entries using a form.
* Display existing data entries in a clear and organized manner.
* Update existing data entries through editing functionality.
* Delete data entries with confirmation.

**Technologies Used**

* React: The primary JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* MockAPI: A free and convenient API simulation tool for development purposes. (You can optionally link to MockAPI's documentation here).

**Installation**

1. Clone this repository using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/re-sohail/React-CRUD-App-with-MockAPI.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd crud
   ```

3. Install the project's dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

**Running the Application**

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. The application will typically run on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `package.json`). Open this URL in your web browser.

**API**

(Replace the placeholder URL with the actual endpoint of your MockAPI)

The application interacts with a MockAPI endpoint at `https://663a67171ae792804bef3b8b.mockapi.io/crud`. This endpoint provides access to the data that is managed within the application.
